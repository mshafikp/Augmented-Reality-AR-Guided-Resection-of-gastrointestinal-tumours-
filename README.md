# Augmented-Reality-AR-Guided-Resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumours

## Overview

This project implements an Augmented Reality (AR) simulation system designed to assist in the resection of gastrointestinal tumors. The system features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be projected onto any surface, allowing surgeons to interact with endoscopic video data using gesture controls. The primary functionality of the system includes extracting tumor data from the video and enabling thorough examination through AR visualization.

## Features

- **GUI Projection:** The interface can be projected on any wall, providing flexibility in different operating environments.
- **Endoscopy Video Integration:** Uses real endoscopy videos to simulate the surgical environment.
- **Gesture Control:** Allows users to interact with the system and manipulate tumor data using hand gestures.
- **AR Visualization:** Extracted tumor data can be examined in a 3D AR environment for better assessment and planning.

## Installation

To run the AR simulation system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mshafikp/Augmented-Reality-AR-Guided-Resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumours-.git
   cd Augmented-Reality-AR-Guided-Resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumours-
